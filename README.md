# Cooking by the book

## About
This project was made for COP3530, Data Structures and Algorithms at UF.  

A dataset of around 200,000 recipes are used for this project, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_recipes.csv), and the purpose of this project is to help users find recipes for cooking. Since there are so many recipes, how can anyone be expected to find what they want given certain specifications? That's where Cooking by the Book comes in handy.

Two different data structures are compared, a Heap and a B+ Tree, to see which is best for holding and retrieving recipes. 

To use, unzip the 'reduced.zip' file into wherever your project folder is located.
